# Word-Unscrambler
Word Unscrambler built in Java. A try to implement database concept: indexing in Java.
The code right now does the indexing part, where it divides the dictionary provided to it
into files named "F<NUMBER_OF_LETTERS>" format. This approach makes the searching of the 
words easier. 
Further approach is to make use of Trie data structure to make the searching more efficient.
